One of the first managers I had told me that people stay at companies for 5 reasons:

1. **Growth:** The company is growing quickly. This one can be broken down into two separate dimensions: Personal Growth (the person can learn how to build a hypergrowth company or take on new roles) or Equity Growth (this person's stake in the company will be really valuable given how quickly the company is growing).

2. **Learning:** The person is learning a lot. This is the manager's responsibility for ensuring that the person has a skills roadmap and a career path, but also the companies responsibility for ensuring that the career path is viable for the company.

3. **Pay:** The person is getting paid a lot. Interestingly, this is usually the last on the list.

4. **Community:** They enjoy the working environment. This is both friends (they like the people they work with) and culture / vibes (they resonate with the culture and feel a sense of identity coming from the [rituals](https://www.notion.so/Culture-and-Rituals-1c730b4ce18180ae91c9caff495a1757?pvs=21) of the company).

5. **Mission:** They believe in the mission.
